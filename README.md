## A Geospatial Addressing Solution by India Post

DIGIPIN (Digital PIN) is a 10-character alphanumeric geocode developed by the Department of Posts, India. It provides a precise, user-friendly way to encode geographic coordinates that can be easily shared and decoded back to latitude/longitude pairs.

This open-source Node.js project exposes a public API to generate and decode DIGIPINs, supporting geolocation services, postal logistics, and spatial analysis applications.
